# Role Story
A bounty hunter, as the name suggests, is a hunter who aims for bounties.<br>
Even though he was forced onto this path, he could only act according to the killer's style of taking money to complete jobs.<br>
Gradually, as the number of his killings increased, he transformed from someone who was once afraid of killing into someone who killed without hesitation.<br>
His blade became sharper, the bounties piled higher, and no one knows how long his journey of bounty hunting will last.
