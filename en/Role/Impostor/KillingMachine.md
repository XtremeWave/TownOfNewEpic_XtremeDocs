The Killing Machine has a very short kill cooldown.<br>
But cannot vent, has lower vision, cannot sabotage, cannot report, and cannot call emergency meetings. The Killing Machine also has the same vision as Crewmates.

- Max
# Role Story
The prime objective of its invention is simple ———— just killing.<br>
Its exclusive function is to murder crewmates.<br>
Nonetheless, it outperforms all impostors, owing to its nature as an emotionless mechanical entity.<br>
As the chronometer marks the passage of time: who will be the next casualty?
